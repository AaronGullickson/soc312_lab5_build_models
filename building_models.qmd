## Instructions

Please do not modify anything above this section, except for your name in the author field at the top.

Follow the instructions on Canvas to create a PDF from this quarto file that describes several multivariate models. You can use the template below to get started, but ultimately you should replace everything with the correct variables and you should also remove these instructions.

## This is a section header

This is some random text that you should replace with a description of the results from your table. Take the time to describe your results thoroughly.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-models
#| tbl-cap: Table caption goes here
#| results: asis

# This is an R code chunk. The R code here is producing an easily readable table
# of regression model results. You can get a preview of this table by hitting
# the green play button on the right. You can use this R code chunk as a
# template for your own, but you should replace the code with proper code for
# the assignment.

model1 <- lm(box_office~I(runtime-90), data=movies)
model2 <- lm(box_office~I(runtime-90)+maturity_rating, data=movies)
model3 <- lm(box_office~I(runtime-90)+maturity_rating+I(metascore-50), data=movies)
model4 <- lm(box_office~I(runtime-90)*maturity_rating+I(metascore-50), data=movies)

# IMPORTANT: switch this to texreg when you are ready to render to PDF
screenreg(list(model1, model2, model3, model4),
        caption.above = TRUE,
        #Comment out custom.coef.names until your models are ready for knitting
        #custom.coef.names = c("Intercept", "Runtime in minutes (centered on 90)",
        #                      "PG","PG-13","R","Metascore (centered on 50)",
        #                       "Runtime x PG","Runtime x PG-13",
        #                       "Runtime x R"),
        custom.gof.names = c("R-squared","N"),
        digits=2,
        include.adjrs=FALSE, include.rmse=FALSE,
        custom.note = "%stars. Standard errors in parenthesis.")
